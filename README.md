                                      Digital Music Store Analysis Project

The Digital Music Store Analysis project is a comprehensive exploration and analysis of a digital music store's sales and customer behavior. It involves examining the store's database, which consists of several interconnected tables representing artists, albums, tracks, customers, playlists, and playlist tracks.

The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into the sales patterns, revenue generation, customer preferences, and overall performance of the digital music store. By leveraging SQL queries, various aspects of the business are analyzed, such as top-selling tracks and albums, customer spending behavior, popular genres, and playlist statistics.

The Queries I have solved in this project using different interconnected tables are listed below:
1) Total revenue generated by the store?
2) Top 5 senior most employees based on job title?
3) Return all albums along with their corresponding artists:
4) Find all playlists and the number of tracks in each playlist:
5) Which countries have the most Invoices?
6) Return all the track names that have a song length longer than the average song length.
7) Write query to return the email, first name, last name, & Genre of all Rock Music listeners and sort by email


The project demonstrates my proficiency in SQL and data analysis, showcasing my ability to extract meaningful information from complex databases and contribute to data-driven decision-making processes.
